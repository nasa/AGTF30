        Purpose
</div>

<p>
    This block can be used to simulate the performance of a compressor using basic
thermodynamic equations, properties, and table-lookups.
</p>

<br>
<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

        Background
</div>

<p>
    This block utilizes the Compressor_TMATS.c script to compute the output gas characteristics
    and other variables.
</p>
<p>
    To compute the input enthalpy and entropy, the script uses a table-lookup
    method using the input temperature, pressure, and fuel to air ratio
    as reference values.
</p>
<p>
    A couple of values related to the fluid flow are then calculated using
    the following equations:

    $$\delta = \frac{Pt_{In}}{\textit{C_PSTD}}$$
    $$\Theta = \frac{Tt_{In}}{\textit{C_TSTD}}$$

    In the equations above, <i>C_PSTD</i> and <i>C_TSTD</i> are standard day
    conditions for pressure and temperature, respectively.
    Using the calculated values from these equations, the corrected flow
    can be determined by the following:

    $$Wc_{In} = W_{In}*\frac{\sqrt{\Theta}}{\delta}$$

    Likewise, the corrected shaft speed is determined by:

    $$Nc = \frac{Nmech}{\sqrt{\Theta}}$$
</p>

<p>
    General compressor performance is dictated by a compressor map that relates
    corrected shaft speed and an arbitrarily defined monotonically increasing Rline
    to corrected mass flow, pressure ratio, and efficiency. Values in this map may be scaled
    (for example 100% shaft speed might correlate to 20,000 rpm), so in this discussion all values
    taken from the map will be refered to as Map parameters. <br>
    The compressor speed map is determined by using the corrected shaft speed
    and the user-specified corrected speed scalar constant (<i>C_Nc</i>), as
    seen in the following equation:

    $$ NcMap = \frac{Nc}{\textit{C_Nc}} $$

    The value of <i>C_Nc</i> is dependant upon which iDesign (iDes) option
    is used.

</p>
<p>
    The iDes option can be accessed by double clicking the block, navigating
    to the iDesign tab, and entering 0, 1, or 2 for the option of <i>iDesign_M</i>.
    <ul>
        <li>If 0 is input, iDes will be enabled and the compressor map scalars (such as
        <i>C_Nc</i>) will be based on design variables specified by the user in
        the iDesign tab. These values are output to a specified file (<i>FVar_M</i>).
        <li>If 1 is input, the scalars will be determined from a specified
        file (<i>FVar_M</i>) that is uploaded by the user and specified in the iDesign tab.
        <li>If 2 is input, the scalars will be determined by the scalars specified in
        the C-Map tab (such as <i>s_C_Nc_M</i>); no values from the iDesign tab
        will be used.
    </ul>
    For more information on how to enable iDes and the different
    options for how to use it, see the Mask Variables table at the bottom of this page.

</p>
<p>
    To compute the total flow input, the script utilizes the user-specified compressor map,
    interpolates the results, and then scales the results using the user-specified
    flow scalar constant according to the following equation:

    $$ WcCalc_{In} = WcMap * \textit{C_Wc}$$

    The value of the flow scalar constant <i>C_Wc</i> is dependant
    upon which iDes option is used, as previously described and as detailed
    in the Mask Variable table at the bottom of this page.

</p>
<p>
    In order to determine the output total pressure, the pressure ratio that
    the compressor is operating at must first be determined. The pressure ratio is
    determined by the following equation:

    $$ PR = \textit{C_PR} * (PRMap - 1) +1 $$

    in which <i>PRMap</i> is determined by interpolating the compressor map
    and <i>C_PR</i> is dependant upon which iDes option is used.

    Once the pressure ratio is calculated, the total output pressure can be
    calculated using the following equation:

    $$Pt_{Out} = Pt_{In}*PR$$

</p>
<p>
    The overall efficiency of the compressor can be determined by the following
    equation:

    $$Eff = EffMap * \textit{C_Eff} $$

    in which <i>EffMap</i> is determined by interpolating the compressor map
    and <i>C_Eff</i> is dependant upon which iDes option is used.

</p>
<p>
    To compute the output total enthalpy, the script assumes that the compressor
    is isentropic such that input entropy is equal to output entropy. This allows
    for a table-lookup of the ideal total temperature using the entropy, pressure, and
    fuel to air ratio. An additional table-lookup is then done to determine the
    ideal total enthalpy using the ideal total temperature and fuel to air ratio.

    The final total enthalpy output is then determined using the following:

    $$ ht_{Out} = \frac{htIdeal_{Out} - ht_{In}}{Eff} +  ht_{In} $$

    The actual temperature output is then determined via a table-lookup using
    the actual total enthalpy and fuel to air ratio.

</p>
<p>
    The output flow is determined by the following equation:

    $$ W_{Out} = W_{In} - Wbleeds $$

    In the above equation, <i>Wbleeds</i> is the amount of flow that has left
    the system and can be determined in two ways. First,
    <i>Wbleeds</i> can be calculated based on user-specified customer bleeds (constant bleed value)
    and/or it can be calculated based on user-specified fractional bleeds.
    Multipule or none of these bleed flows can be specified by enabling or disabling these options.
</p>
<p>
    These two types of bleeds are determined by the following equations.
    In the code, the customer bleeds are evaluated first and then the
    fractional bleeds are evaluated and added to the customer bleed in order
    to determine the total flow that is bled off.
</p>
<p>
    Total bleed flow for the compressor is calculated by summing the specified flows:

    $$Wbleeds = \sum Wfrac + \sum Wcust$$

    In the above equation, <i>Wcust</i> are the values <i>C_CBD_M</i> (mask variable).
    The <i>Wfrac</i> values are the values <i>C_FBD_M</i> (mask variable) multiplied by input flow, <i>Win</i>.
</p>
<p>
    While computing the bleed, the script also calculates the total
    enthalpy and pressure that is lost due to each bleed. These values are
    determined by the following equations, respectively:

    $$htcust_{Out} = ht_{In} + FracBldht*(ht_{Out} - ht_{In})$$
    $$Ptcust_{Out} = Pt_{In} + FracBldPt*(Pt_{Out} -Pt_{In})$$

    In the above equations, <i>FracBldht</i> and <i>FracBldPt</i> refer
    to the fractional enthalpy and pressure gains by the flow before the bleed occurs.
    Although imperfect, these factional values are meant to simulate bleed at an internal stage.
    So, for example, if bleed occurs at stage 4 of an 8 stage compressor these fractional values might be 0.5.
    In addition to calculating the total enthalpy and total pressure for the
    bleed, the total temperature is determined by a table-lookup method using
    the total enthalpy as the search criteria.
</p>

<p>
    The output power is determined in a similar manner as the output flow.
    Like the output flow, the output power depends on both the input power
    and the amount of power bled off; the equation used to solve for the
    output power is below.

    $$Pwr_{Out} = Pwrb4bleed - PwrBld$$

    The ideal power stored in the system (<i>Pwrb4bleed</i>) is given by:

    $$ Pwrb4bleed = W_{In}*(ht_{in} - ht_{out})*\textit{C_BTU_PER_SECtoHP}$$

    in which <i>C_BTU_PER_SECtoHP</i> is the constant to convert BTU/s to HP.
</p>
<p>
    The power that bleeds from the system (<i>PwrBld</i>) is determined
    by sumation of the power that is bled off.

    $$PwrBld = \sum Wbld*(htbld_{Out}-ht_{Out})*\textit{C_BTU_PER_SECtoHP}$$
where <i>bld</i> variables are fractional and/or customer bleed values.
</p>
<p>
    The output torque to the shaft is determined by the output power and
    the shaft speed, as seen in the following equation:

    $$Torque_{Out} = \textit{C_HP_PER_RPMtoFT_LBF} * \frac{Pwr_{Out}}{Nmech}$$

    in which <i>C_HP_PER_RPMtoFT_LBF</i> is a constant used to convert the units.

</p>
<p>
    The computation of the normalized flow error depends on if iDes is enabled
    or not. If iDes is enabled, <i>NErrorOut</i> is determined by the following:

    $$NErrorOut = \frac{(Rline - RlineDes)}{Rline}$$

    In the above equation, the <i>Rline</i> values are determined from the
    user-specified compressor map. If iDes is disabled, <i>NErrorOut</i> is
    determined by:

    $$NErrorOut = \frac{(Wc_{In} - WcCalc_{In})}{Wc_{In}}$$

    <em>Note:</em> Divide by zero protection is implmented on these equations and if <i>Rline</i> is equal
    to zero, <i>NErrorOut</i> will be equal to 100. This will also occur if
    <i>Wc<sub>In</sub></i> is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>
    To determine the available stall margin, the following equation was used:

    $$SMavail = \frac{SPR - PR}{PR} * 100 $$

    in which

    $$SPR = \textit{C_PR}*(SPRMap -1)+1$$

    where <i>SPRMap</i> is determined by interpolating values on the compressor
    map and <i>C_PR</i> is dependant upon which iDes option is used. The stall margin map is then determined using the following:

    $$SMMap = \frac{SPRMap - PRMap}{PRMap} * 100$$
